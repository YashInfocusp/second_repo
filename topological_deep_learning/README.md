# Topological Deep Learning for 3D Point Clouds

This project aims to develop and implement a topological deep learning algorithm for analyzing 3D point cloud data.

## Project Structure

- **/data**: Contains the 3D point cloud dataset. See `data/README.md` for more details.
- **/src**: Contains the source code for the algorithm implementation, including data processing, topological feature extraction, model definition, and training scripts. See `src/algorithm.py` as a starting point.

## Goal

The goal is to leverage topological features from 3D point clouds to enhance the performance and interpretability of deep learning models for tasks such as classification, segmentation, or shape analysis.

## Getting Started

1.  **Dataset**: Place your 3D point cloud dataset in the `data/` directory.
2.  **Algorithm**: Implement the core algorithm components in `src/algorithm.py` and potentially other modules within the `src/` directory.
3.  **Dependencies**: (To be defined) List any necessary libraries or frameworks here.
4.  **Training**: (To be defined) Provide instructions on how to train the model.
5.  **Evaluation**: (To be defined) Provide instructions on how to evaluate the model.
