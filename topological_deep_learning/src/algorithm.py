# Placeholder for the Topological Deep Learning Algorithm

"""
This file will contain the implementation of the topological deep learning algorithm
for 3D point cloud data.

This includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing specific to the algorithm.
- Topological feature extraction (e.g., persistent homology).
- Neural network architecture definition.
- Training loop and evaluation metrics.
